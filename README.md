# TMDB - TileMuon Digitizer Board

The main source of the Level-1 Muon Trigger background in the ATLAS endcap region is low momentum protons emerging from the endcap toroid magnets and the beam shielding. They produce correlated hits leading to coincidences in the trigger chambers up to the highest transverse momentum muon threshold. In order to decrease the Level-1 Muon Trigger rate, a coincidence system using TileCal and Muon detectors is implemented assisted by TMDB.

The Tile Muon Digitizer Board has been designed to process (receive and digitize) the data coming from the D-layer channels of the TileCal Extended Barrel module, to estimate the energy using a Matched Filter (MF) approach and to apply a threshold. The decision is sent to the TGC Sector-Logic Boards. Since each TileCal cell has double readout and the information from D5 and D6 cells are used, the TMDB system processes a total of 2x64x4=512 signals. On the TGC side, 48 Sector-Logic Boards receive the TMDB output signal to perform the final decision. The whole system consists of 16 TMDBs. Each TMDB receives signal from 8 TileCal modules (32 PMTs) and has 3 optical links to interface with the TGC Sector-Logic Boards.
