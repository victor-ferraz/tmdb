# TMDB - TileMuon Digitizer Board

The main source of the Level-1 Muon Trigger background in the ATLAS endcap region is low momentum protons emerging from the endcap toroid magnets and the beam shielding. They produce correlated hits leading to coincidences in the trigger chambers up to the highest transverse momentum muon threshold. In order to decrease the Level-1 Muon Trigger rate, a coincidence system using TileCal and Muon detectors is implemented assisted by TMDB.
