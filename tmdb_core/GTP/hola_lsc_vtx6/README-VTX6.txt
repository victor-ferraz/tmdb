Description
===========
Firmware for a HOLA type S-LINK Link Source (LSC) implementation for Virtex-6 family FPGAs using the embedded GTX transceivers

Files
=====
+ hola_lsc_vtx6.vhd
  This is the top level which instantiates the HOLA S-LINK core and the TLK2501 emulation.

+ tlk_wrapper_vtx6.vhd   
  This is the TLK2501 emulation layer. It already includes the differential input buffer for the MGT reference clock. If you need this in other places of the design you may have to pull it out of this entity. Buffering of the receive and transmit clock is done using BUFGs, if needed because of resource constarints, they could be replaced by BUFRs.

+ tlk_gtx_interface.vhd
  This adapts the GTX fabric interface to the TLK parallel interface used by the HOLA LSC core.

+ hola_tlk_gtx.vhd
+ hola_tlk_gtx_gtx.vhd
+ double_reset.vhd
  This is the GTX instantiation, these files are generated by the Xilinx Virtex-6 GTX transceiver wizard (version 1.11).

+ hola_tlk_gtx.xco
  Xilinx core generator output file, this can be used to recustomize the GTX, e.g. in order to change the reference clock frequency or adapt the serial I/O settings to the target board (differential swing, pre-emphasis, equalization, etc.).

+ hola_lsc_core.vhd
  This is the HOLA LSC core.

+ xfifolsc.ngc
+ xfifolsc.xco
  This is the small asynchronous FIFO required by the HOLA LSC core. Created by the Xilinx FIFO generator (version 8.3).

Tools
=====
Synopsys Synplify Premier (2011.09) was used for logic synthesis and Xilinx ISE (13.3) for implementation.
